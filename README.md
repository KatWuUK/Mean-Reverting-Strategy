# Mean-Reverting-Strategy
Applied simple moving average approach with a look-back window of 14 days which gave the optimal output
Potential future work to be done soon:
-Test using multiple fields as a basket
-Compare different technical analysis methods including Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
